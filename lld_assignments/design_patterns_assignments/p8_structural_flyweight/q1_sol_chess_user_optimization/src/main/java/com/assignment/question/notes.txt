Intrinsic state:
These are the properties or characteristics that are inherent and essential to something.
They do not depend on external factors or the environment.
For example, the intrinsic state of a rubber band would include its elasticity, its material (rubber), and its shape when it is not stretched.

Extrinsic state:
These are the properties or characteristics that are not inherent and depend on external factors or the environment.
They can change based on outside influences.
For example, the extrinsic state of a rubber band would include how much it is stretched, the temperature of the room it is in, or how much force is being applied to it.

Think of it like this:
intrinsic properties are like your basic, unchangeable qualities (such as your DNA or your date of birth),
while extrinsic properties are like the clothes you wear or your current mood, which can change depending on the situation or environment.
